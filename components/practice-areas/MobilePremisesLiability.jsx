            What Is Premises Liability In California?
          </p>
          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            If you are injured on someone’s property in California, the state’s
            premises liability laws will come into play. Premises liability
            refers to the property owner’s legal obligation to care for and
            maintain the property. California property owners must use
            reasonable dare to maintain their property safely. This is the same
            duty of care that other reasonable property owners would use in the
            same situation. If the owner fails to show you a duty of care, they
            will be responsible for your injuries and damages.

            California Premises Liability Laws
          </p>
          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            California Civil Code 1714 states that all property owners are
            liable if their lack of duty of care or skill in property management
            leads to injury. The critical part of the statute is the lack of
            ordinary care and skill. This concerns the legal definition of
            negligence, which is the basis of almost every premises liability
            claim. Negligence means a person’s carelessness that caused harm to
            someone. Under the premises liability laws of this state, the
            owner’s negligence usually describes the property’s dangerous
            condition. But the owner failed to take action to fix the hazard.
            The legal definition of negligence relates to the property owner’s
            duty of care. The duty of care is how much care a prudent and
            reasonable would engage in if a similar situation arises. Whether
            the owner breached the duty of care depends on the situation. What
            was the defect on the property? Did the owner know about it? Did the
            owner contribute to the hazard?

            Who Can You Sue In A California Premises Liability Case?
          </p>
          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            California law states that if you are hurt on someone’s property,
            you can usually file a claim against the owner, property manager, or
            others charged with controlling the property. However, the
            defendant’s party in a premises liability claim depends on the
            circumstances. Usually, the liable party is the person or firm that
            owns, leases, or occupies the property. Defendants in a premises
            liability case could include:

            Proving Premises Liability
          </p>
          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            Holding a property owner or manager liable for an accident means
            proving premises liability. The burden of proof in a civil lawsuit
            is on you, the plaintiff. You and your attorney must prove the
            defendant was negligent and caused the accident and subsequent
            injuries. The burden of proof in a premises liability case is a
            ‘preponderance of the evidence.’ This means there is “clear and
            convincing” evidence that shows the other party was 51% or more at
            fault. During the case, your attorney must show the other party was
            more likely than not liable for causing your injuries.

            You only have a limited time to file a premises liability claim in

            compensation. If you were not aware of your injury for a period of

            A California premises liability lawyer can help you receive as much
            compensation as possible for your damages and injuries. These
            attorneys know better than laypeople what a premises liability case
            is worth. It means your lawyer will not shrink from a tough
            insurance adjuster who doesn’t want to offer a fair settlement for
            your painful injuries. Your attorney also may find hidden case
            value, such as finding evidence that others overlooked. When this
            happens, they may increase the payout you receive. Also, once the
            attorney takes your case, you do not have to worry about legal
            issues. Your attorney will handle everything regarding evidence
            collection, negotiating with insurance companies, and making the
            necessary legal documents and filings with the court. Last, almost
            all premises liability lawyers offer free consultations. You can get
            legal advice about the validity of the case and pay nothing. If they
            take the case, you will not pay anything unless the attorney wins
            the case.

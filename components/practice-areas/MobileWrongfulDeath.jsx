            negligence led to a family losing a loved one. We have helped

          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            There are strict protocols for when a police officer can use their
            weapon in the line of duty. If an officer did not follow these
            rules, they could be tried in criminal court, while the surviving
            family members could seek compensation in civil court. Our wrongful
            death lawyers know every protocol, and can help answer any questions
            regarding a potential case.

            California is considered a fault state, so you must prove that the

            The statute of limitations for a wrongful death car accident case in

            Jail/Prison Suicide

            While prison guards are not expected to prevent every possible
            suicide, they are expected to properly screen inmates for any mental
            health issues or suicide risk. If an inmate has shown signs of
            mental illness or is at-risk for committing suicide and they are
            neglected by prison staff, the prison could be liable for their
            suicide.

            Who Can File A Claim?
          </p>
          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            In California, only certain individuals are allowed to file a
            wrongful death claim. The parties that are allowed to bring a
            wrongful death claim are the deceased person’s surviving spouse,
            domestic partner, or surviving children. If no descendent exists, a
            wrongful death claim can be brought by a person who would be
            entitled to the property of the deceased by intestate succession.
            These parties include the parents of the deceased or their siblings,
            depending on who is living at the time. If they can prove financial
            dependence, other individuals who can file a wrongful death claim
            are a putative spouse, their children, or any stepchildren.

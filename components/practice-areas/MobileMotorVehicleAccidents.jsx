            Always Get The Other Driver’s Information
          </p>
          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            We have seen countless situations where people failed to collect the
            other driver’s information. This makes it very hard when making a
            claim for any injuries or damage to your vehicle. In the event the
            other driver runs after the accident, be sure to contact the police
            and stay at the scene to file a report.

            Take Photos of Your Car’s Damage and Any Other Vehicles Involved in
            the Acciden
          </p>
          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            Car damage in accidents is not always equal. Sometimes, a larger car
            might have very minor damage, while a smaller vehicle could be
            totalled. A common insurance tactic is to devalue a claim because
            there wasn’t significant damage to the claimant’s vehicle. The best
            thing you can do after an accident is take several photos of any
            involved vehicles.

            Was the at-fault party a local, state or federal government entity?

          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            The statute of limitations for a wrongful death car accident case in
            California is two years from the date of loss. If the involved party
            was a government entity, the statute of limitations is only six
            months from the date of loss.

            Jail/Prison Suicide
          </p>

          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            While prison guards are not expected to prevent every possible
            suicide, they are expected to properly screen inmates for any mental
            health issues or suicide risk. If an inmate has shown signs of
            mental illness or is at-risk for committing suicide and they are
            neglected by prison staff, the prison could be liable for their
            suicide.

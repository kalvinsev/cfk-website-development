          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            White-collar crime cases are rarely simple as usually, they are
            mazes of financial documents, business decisions, electronic
            records, and more. However, our experienced lawyers know how to
            navigate through these complex mazes. At CFK Trial Lawyers for the People,
            we understand how easily white-collar crime charges can arise. We
            have seen them appear as the result of an honest financial mistake,
            of poor business agreements, or simply because of false accusations.
            A successful criminal defense strategy often requires finding a
            needle in a haystack. We will leave no stone unturned in our
            investigations, which is why we have a strong record of success.
            Please contact us to see if we can help. Moreover, we know how to

            What Is a &quot;White-Collar Crime&quot;?
          </p>
          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            In general, the term &quot;white collar crime&quot; is used to refer
            to non-violent offenses associated with &quot;white collar&quot;
            workers, especially those working in finance. White-collar crime is
            typically thought of as an offense involving monetary losses. This
            may involve a business, someone’s personal finances, or even local,
            state, and federal agencies.
          </p>
          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            Although white-collar crimes can take many different forms, some
            common ones include:

          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            This refers to any act or pattern of action that is intended to
            defraud a bank of funds. Using a stolen identity to make or access
            an account, creating a fake business, and trying to pass stolen
            checks can all be forms of bank fraud.

            Embezzlement occurs when someone is entrusted with company property

          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            Blackmail is a white-collar crime if it is performed by someone in a
            place of power within a company who uses threats of bodily harm or
            reputation damage to demand money or other items of value from
            someone else. Blackmail often involves a threat of revealing
            damaging secrets about someone.

            Investment Schemes

            These are situations in which a person is promised a return on an
            investment, which is typically never made while the invested money
            is kept by the perpetrator. Ponzi schemes are among these well-known
            white-collar crimes.

          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            A few more examples of white-collar crime include wire fraud, tax

          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            The dollar amounts in these kinds of cases can be substantial, which

            Intent
          </p>

          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            Legally speaking, “intent” means that a defendant did not have to
            commit the crime, only desire to commit the crime and take steps to
            commit it. To convict a defendant of bank fraud, for example, the
            prosecution must show that the defendant intended to defraud a bank
            of money, assets, or property. Mistakenly taking funds from a bank
            due to a filing error is not a crime, as it lacked intent on the
            defendant’s part.

            Intent is not enough for a court to convict a defendant for a
            white-collar crime. In addition to intending to commit the crime,
            the defendant must have been capable of committing the crime.

            Fraud
          </p>

          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            Fraud refers to the act of using deceit, trickery, or lies to
            falsely represent or conceal certain facts. This can be done to
            acquire someone else’s property or to damage another person’s
            finances. Fraud plays a role in most white-collar crimes, especially
            those involving contracts, legal agreements, and the sharing of
            financial information.

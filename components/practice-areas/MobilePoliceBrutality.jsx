            Excessive Force & Violence
          </p>
          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            Our police brutality lawyers examine the actions taken against a
            person or group of people by a police officer. The primary question
            is were the actions considered excessive to the actions any
            reasonable officer would take. Common examples involve the use of:
          </p>
          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            Firearms – If an officer uses their firearm in a situation that did
            not warrant its use, and someone was hurt as a result, this could be
            grounds for a claim. Batons – There are protocols in place for the
            proper use of batons by police officers. Examples of these protocols
            include no strikes to the head or stopping if an individual has been
            subdued. Potential excessive force injuries include concussion and
            broken bones. Tasers – these devices can be very dangerous for
            people with heart conditions. The high voltage discharge from a
            taser can cause serious damage to the heart and its rhythm. Like a
            baton, police officers have to follow a strict protocol when using a
            taser. Chokeholds – Recent events have highlighted the danger of
            chokeholds. With many departments banning them, victims of police
            chokeholds may have a legal claim. Pepper Spray – A common deterrent
            used for crowd control, pepper spray can have damaging effects on
            the lungs. Excessive use would constitute use beyond the point that
            someone was subdued or showed signs of breathing trouble.

            Racial Profiling
          </p>
          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            Many racial profiling legal cases involve a violation of a person’s
            4th ammendment right against unlawful search and seizure. Another
            violation is against their 14th amendment right to due process.
            Police officers need to have observed a crime or have credible
            information to detain someone. Our law firm represents clients that
            have had their civil rights violated by racial profiling. If you
            have any questions about a potential claim, contact us here. We
            offer a free consultation.

            Sexual Assault
          </p>
          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            Another abuse of power by police officers is through sexual
            misconduct. If an officer uses their power to force unwanted
            advances onto you, we recommend speaking with a civil rights
            attorney. Sometimes these incidents are more subtle, where
            individuals were coerced into complying with unwanted advances by
            police officers. In these cases, we would still advise speaking with
            an attorney. Blackmail Police officers can use their status or power
            to blackmail individuals to avoid jail or other punishment. This is
            also a violation, and our firm can help individuals seek justice for
            it.

          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            If you have been injured by a police officer, we recommend seeing a
            doctor and getting on the path to recovery. Your health and
            wellbeing is the top priority. Another important reason is that a
            doctor can get your injuries documented, which will help you with

          <p className="mission-statement-paragraph-elements">
            In addition to documenting any injuries, you should begin gathering
            any evidence you can to help you build a case. If there were any
            witnesses, security camera footage, police reports – these can all
            help you build a stronger case.

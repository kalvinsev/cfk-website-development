            In addition to Civil Rights experience, our attorneys have
            represented clients who have been injured due to the negligence of
            another person or entity. We work with our clients to make sure that
            they focus on their recovery after an accident while we move their
            claim forward. Every personal injury case involves some type of
            negligence. Another party must have acted in a way that a reasonable
            person would not which resulted in another person being injured. The
            most common type of personal injury case is a car accident. Was the
            party speeding, drunk or in some other way negligent at the time of
            the accident? You may have a case.
